# POSTER-EVALUATION
POSTER EVALUATION WEBSITE

The project's goal is to develop an extensive, web-based Poster review and Analysis System that will enable users to upload posters for review, get in-depth comments and suggestions, and view the evaluation's findings. The system makes effective use of Python, Flask, HTML, Py-Tesseract, and Convolutional Neural Networks and runs well on Windows.
